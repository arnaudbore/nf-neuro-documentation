Modules and subworkflows expose configuration endpoints that can be set at runtime. Look for the `arguments` section in
the API documentation. Refer to the correct section below for information on the configuration procedure respective to
each component.

## Module Configuration

Modules are configured through the `ext` parameter mapping, exclusive to each of them. Configuration **must be done
inside** `nextflow.config` **files**, it cannot be done in `.nf` files. The configuration endpoint is accessible in the
`process` scope :

```groovy
process {
    ext.parameter_one = "value"
}
```

To restrict the configuration to a specific module, say `MODULE_1`, use the `withName` process selector :

```groovy
process {
    withName: "MODULE_1" {
        ext.parameter_one = "value"
    }
}
```

Refer to the **arguments** section of modules in the [nf-neuro API documentation](/nf-neuro/api/categories) for
available configuration endpoints and to the nextflow documentation for more information on
[configuration](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) and
[process selectors](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#process-selectors).

:::caution
By default, when configurations are provided by nf-neuro subworkflows, they use the **lowest priority selector available**.
To ensure your selector targets the right module, in the right subworkflow, use its **fully qualified name**. For example,
`MODULE_1` inside of `SUBWORKFLOW_2` has the fully qualified name : `SUBWORKFLOW_2::MODULE_1`.
:::

## Subworkflow configuration

Subworkflows expose `params` configuration endpoints directly. You can define them either in the `nextflow.config` or in
the `.nf` file that includes it.

```groovy

params {
    subworkflow_parameter = "value"
}
```
