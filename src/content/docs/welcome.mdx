### Build efficient neuroimaging pipelines

<b><i style="color:#24b064ff">nf-neuro</i></b> is an open-source initiative originally developed by the [Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab](https://scil.usherbrooke.ca/) (SCIL) 

Our mission is to provide researchers with scalable, reproducible, and efficient pipelines for neuroimaging applications.

### Why Choose nf-neuro?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Reproducibility" icon="rocket">
		**nf-neuro** contains **thoroughly tested and validated** modules to built
		efficient neuroimaging pipeline ensuring **reproducible results**.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Development guidelines" icon="document">
		`nf-neuro` is built against the **`nf-core` guidelines**, which promotes
    high coding standards and good practice.
	</Card>
  <Card title="State-of-the-art neuroimaging tools" icon="seti:powershell">
    `nf-neuro` regroups multiple modules using **state-of-the-art tools** from
    popular libraries (e.g., FSL, ANTs, scilpy, etc.).
  </Card>
	<Card title="Portability" icon="cloud-download">
		Each components from nf-neuro have their **own container** (Docker or Singularity).
    Enabling an **easy use** on all architectures.
