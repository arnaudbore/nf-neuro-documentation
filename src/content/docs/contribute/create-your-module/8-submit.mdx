## Lint your code

Before submitting to _nf-neuro_, once you've commit and push everything, the code need to be correctly linted, else the checks won't pass. This is done using `prettier` and `editorconfig-checker` on your new module, through the _nf-core_ command line :

```bash
nf-core modules lint <category>/<tool>
```

You'll probably get a bunch of _whitespace_ and _indentation_ errors, but also image errors, bad _nextflow_ syntax and more. You need to fix all `errors` and as much as the `warnings` as possible.

If at any point you modified files outside of your module's directory, those also need to be linted. To do so, run the following commands at the root of the repository :

```bash
prettier --check .
editorconfig-checker
```

You'll get lists of syntax errors to fix from both commands. For prettier, you can run `prettier --write .` to fix most of them automatically. For `editorconfig-checker`, you'll have to fix them manually.

## Submit your PR

Open a PR to the `nf-neuro` repository master. We'll test everything, make sure it's
working and that code follows standards.
