import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This tutorial series focusing on the contribution of a subworkflow to `nf-neuro`. In it, you will create a subworkflow
from **anatomical MRI preprocessing**, using components already implemented in `nf-neuro` for
[denoising](/nf-neuro/api/modules/preproc_anat), [brain extraction](/nf-neuro/api/modules/betcrop/antsbet),
[intensity normalization](/nf-neuro/api/modules/preproc/n4) and [segmentation](/nf-neuro/api/subworkflows/anatomical_segmentation).

## First steps

If not done already, clone the `nf-neuro` repository locally and navigate to it :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scilus/nf-neuro.git
cd nf-neuro
```

Create a new branch for your subworkflow, following the convention `subworkflow/<category>_<tool>`
for the branch name (for the current tutorial : `subworkflow/preproc_anat`). This will help
you and maintainers keep track of changes made to the subworkflow :

```bash
git checkout -b subworkflow/preproc_anat
```

### Generate the template

In a **terminal** with access to `nf-core`, use `cd` to locate yourself in the `nf-neuro`
repository. Then, generate a **skeleton** for your subworkflow by running the interactive command :

```bash
nf-core subworkflows create
```

Answer the prompts using the information below :

<Steps>
1. **Name of subworkflow** : `preproc_anat`
2. **Github author** : your Github handle, or `@scilus` if you prefer no accreditation.
</Steps>

Alternatively, you can use the following command to supply nearly all information :

```bash
nf-core subworkflows create --author @scilus
```

The command will generate your new subworkflow template in the `./subworkflows/nf-neuro/preproc_anat`
directory. Navigate to it and familiarize yourself with the various files generated. After that,
switch to the next section of the tutorial and proceed to edit the `main.nf` file.
