## Optional module parameters

Then, use `args_for_cmd1` in the script. Defining the actual value for the parameters is done
by means of `.config` files, inside the `process` scope. A global affectation of the parameter
is as simple as :

```groovy
process {
  task.ext.param1 = "<my global value>"
}
```

Doing so will affect **ALL** processes. To scope to a specific process, use the
[process selectors](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#process-selectors)
(`withName:` or `withLabel:`) :

```groovy
process {
  withName: "PROCESS1" {
    task.ext.param1 = "<scoped to PROCESS1 value>"
  }
}
```

You can define the selector on multiple levels and use glob matching, making it so that
it is possible to affect the processes inside a specific workflow as well :

```groovy
process {
  withName: "WORKFLOW_X*" {
    task.ext.param1 = "<scoped to processes in WORKFLOW_X value>"
  }
}
```

:::note
Modules inherit **selectors**. Thus, a module renamed at import (`import {A as B}`)
will be affected both by the selection `withName: "A"` and `withName: "B"`. However,
parameters defined by `B` will have precedence on those define in `A`.

:::caution
The same stands for **selectors** defined on multiple levels, implicit (`withName: WORKFLOW_X*`)
or explicit (`withName: WORKFLOW_Y:B`).
