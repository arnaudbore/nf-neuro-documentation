## Lint your code

Run `prettier` on your new module, through the `nf-core` command line :

```
nf-core subworkflows lint <subworkflow>
```

and fix all `errors` and as many `warnings` as possible. If at any point you modified files outside of your module's directory, those also need to be linted. To do so, run the following commands at the root of the repository :

```bash
prettier --check .
editorconfig-checker
```

You'll get lists of syntax errors to fix from both commands. For prettier, you can run `prettier --write .` to fix most of them automatically. For `editorconfig-checker`, you'll have to fix them manually.

## Submit your PR

Open a PR to the nf-neuro repository `main` branch. We'll test everything, make sure it's
working and that code follows standards.

Once LGTM has been declared, wave to the maintainers and look at your hard work paying off.

PR merged !
