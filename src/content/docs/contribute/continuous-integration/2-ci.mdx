title: Resources for testing 
description: Specify resources requirements for your test cases.
---

Test runners on the online nf-neuro repository restrain their resources usage to specifically what is asked for by
Nextflow through the configuration files. For **nf-neuro tests**, you can find this configuration in
**_tests/config/nextflow.config_**.

**If any of your tests ask for more, you need to define it correctly**.

:::note
**Usually, containers detects out-of-bound resource consumption automatically**. When using the [devcontainer]() or configuring
**Nextflow** to run using `docker` or `apptainer`, tests will fail if they haven't been assigned them sufficiently. It can be
a good way to see if your workload needs more resources quickly !

## Available runner classes

| Runner Class                       | CPUs | RAM |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | --- |
| **(default)**                      | 4    | 4G  |
| **scilus-nf-neuro-bigmem-runners** | 6    | 32G |

## Request for more test resources

:::caution
**Specialized runners are limited !!!** They are allocated for hungry processes, such as **AI/ML** models and **large dataset studies**,
don't abuse them. _The more they are requested for, the longer PR take to merge_. Don't ask for them for nothing, meaning be smart in
designing your modules ! **PRs deemed not needing them will be automatically closed.**
:::

**Custom resource requirements need to be defined in _nextflow.config_ file(s) associated to your tests and/or
test cases**. In them, add the `process.cpu` and `process.memory` and set their requirements as needed :

```
process.memory = '9G'
process.cpus = 6
```

**Select an appropriate runner class for your tests**. To do so, edit **_github/workflows/run_checks_suite.yml_**. Find the
`matrix` definition for the `nf-test` job (currently around `line 133`) and add the following request for a runner in the
`include` section :

```
- runner: <name-of-the-runner-class>
  path: modules/nf-neuro/<category>/<tool>
```
