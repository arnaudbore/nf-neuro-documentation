## Test data infrastructure

`nf-neuro` provides an infrastructure to host and distribute test data, freely available to all
contributors. Access to this data is done through the dedicated subworkflow `LOAD_TEST_DATA`. Test
data packages are listed in `tests/config/test_data.json`. Introspection of their content is
available in VS Code only, using the [Test Data Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nf-neuro.test-data-explorer)
extension. Once installed, it adds the `Test Data Explorer` to the explorer panel (`Ctrl+Shift+E`),
which you can use to browse and download test data packages and their content.

To download test data inside your test workflows, first include the `LOAD_TEST_DATA` workflow
in their `main.nf` :

```groovy
include { LOAD_TEST_DATA } from '../../../../../subworkflows/nf-neuro/load_test_data/main'
```

The workflow has two inputs :

- A channel containing a list of package names to download.

- A name for the temporary directory where the data will be put.

To call it, use the following syntax :

```groovy
archives = Channel.from( [ "<archive1>", "archive2", ... ] )
LOAD_TEST_DATA( archives, "<directory>" )
```

:::caution
This will download the `archives` and unpack them under the `directory`
specified, using the archive's names as `sub-directories` to unpack to.
:::

The archives contents are accessed using the output parameter of the workflow
`LOAD_TEST_DATA.out.test_data_directory`. To create the test input from it for
a given `PROCESS` to test use the `.map` operator :

```groovy
input = LOAD_TEST_DATA.out.test_data_directory
  .map{ test_data_directory -> [
    [ id:'test', single_end:false ], // meta map
    file("${test_data_directory}/<file for input 1>"),
    file("${test_data_directory}/<file for input 2>"),
    ...
  ] }
```

Then feed it to it :

```groovy
PROCESS( input )
```

:::note
The subworkflow must be called individually in each test workflow, even if they download
the same archives, since there is no mechanism to pass data channels to them from the
outside. Nevertheless, downloaded archives are cached locally to ensure efficiency and
preserve bandwidth.
