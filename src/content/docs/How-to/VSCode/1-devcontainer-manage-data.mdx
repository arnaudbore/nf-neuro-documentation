description: Access your data from inside the devcontainer.

### Accessing your data

In the `devcontainer`, you have access to everything located **inside your workspace**. For you, this means
everything that comes bundled in the `scilus/nf-neuro-tutorial` repository. You can call commands to look
outside this directory, like `ls /` or `ls ~`, but you won't find what is on your computer. This is called
**isolation** and is a core feature of containers. It does limit you, but it also means that you can break things
(like deleting everything under `/`) without breaking your computer. Good news though, there are ways to give access
to your data to the container.

#### Small dataset

The simpler way is to **copy your data** in the <span class="text-blue-300">nf-neuro-tutorial</span>
directory on your computer. If you used **VSCode** to clone the repository, it's the path you chose previously.
This will make your data instantly available inside the `devcontainer`, since **VScode connects your workspace**,
available in the <span class="text-blue-300">editor</span>, to the <span class="text-blue-300">nf-neuro-tutorial</span>
directory at launch. This way, any modifications made from your computer reflect instantly inside the container (and
vice-versa).

#### Large dataset

For larger datasets, too heavy to duplicate, copying is impractical. There are 2 ways to deal with this.

1. Mounting paths in the devcontainer

    Define a **new mount point** in the devcontainer definition. You will find it in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
    Look for the **mounts** entry, near <span class="text-blue-300">line 15</span>. To define a mount point add the
    following in the mounts entry :

    ```json
    {
        "source": "<source>",
        "target": "/workspaces/<target>",
        "type": "bind"
    }
    ```

    Replace <span class="text-blue-300">\<source\></span> by the **absolute path** to the data
    on your computer and <span class="text-blue-300">\<target\></span> with the name of the directory
    you'd like your data to be placed inside the container, under `/workspaces`.

    :::caution
    Your **identity** changes inside the container. If the location of the data on your computer is **user
    restricted**, for instance a mounted share accessible with your username, you might not have access to
    it inside the container.

2. Piggyback on Nextflow

    Note that there is also a way to not copy data on your computer. A great feature of Nextflow
    is that it handles **remote files** quite well. By that, we mean <span class="text-blue-300">HTTP
    links</span>, <span class="text-blue-300">amazon s3 buckets</span> and even <span class="text-blue-300">
    ftp links</span>. If possible, define your inputs using those, you'll find all the information needed
    in the [Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/working-with-files.html#remote-files).
