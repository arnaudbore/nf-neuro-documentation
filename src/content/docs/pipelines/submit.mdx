## Requirements

In order to limit the content you need to edit and we need to host, the showcase **automatically scrubs**
your pipeline repository using the *Github API*. Here is a list of the content it will search for you can act
upon :

<Steps>

1. **Your pipeline logo** (if you have once, else we use the boilerplate Github logo).

   Here you have some options, but there are a few **requirements**. Its name must be **prefixed by the name
   of your pipeline** and end with the suffix `-logo`. It must be in **PNG** format. You also need to place
   it in a directory named `assets`. Your setup should look like this for a single logo to use across themes :

   <FileTree>
   - root
      - assets
         - \<pipeline_name\>-logo.png
   </FileTree>
   
   However, the website uses a **light** and a **dark** theme for users convenience. If your logo contains
   colors that do not render well in a given theme, you can provide **one for each** :

   <FileTree>
   - root
      - assets
         - \<pipeline_name\>-light-logo.png
         - \<pipeline_name\>-dark-logo.png
   </FileTree>

2. **Github Topics**. They appear as keywords in bullet in the detailled view.

3. An **excerpt of the README**, displayed as a description.

   :::tip
   We only extract a **few sentences from the first paragraph**, excluding badges, titles, tables
   and images. **Make it count !**
   :::

4. The **license** users must follow when running the pipeline.

5. The **tag of the last release**.

</Steps>

## Include your pipeline in the showcase

### Using the browser
<Steps>

1. If you don't **own a fork** of the [website repository](https://github.com/nf-neuro/website),
   naviguate to it in your browser and create one

   ![clone documentation](../../../assets/images/documentation-clone.png)

2. On your forked repository page, naviguate to `src/content/pipelines` and click on the
   **Add file** button in the top right corner and select the **Create new file** option.

   ![add pipeline file](../../../assets/images/documentation-add-file.png)
   
3. Name the new file `<pipeline name>.yaml` and edit its content to reflect the following :
   ```yaml
   name: <name of the pipeline>
   organisation: <name of the host organisation on Github>
   documentation: <(optional) link to the pipeline's documentation website>
   ```

4. Commit your changes to a new branch on your fork, and open an **Pull Request** on the
   [main website repository](https://github.com/nf-neuro/website/pulls)

</Steps>

### Using a local clone

<Steps>

1. If you don't **own a fork** of the [website repository](https://github.com/nf-neuro/website),
   naviguate to it in your browser, create one and clone it locally.

   ![clone documentation](../../../assets/images/documentation-clone.png)

2. Create a new branch to host the code modifications.

3. Add a new file in `src/content/pipelines`, named `<pipeline name>.yaml` and edit its content
   to reflect the following :
   ```yaml
   name: <name of the pipeline>
   organisation: <name of the host organisation on Github>
   documentation: <(optional) link to the pipeline's documentation website>
   ```

4. Commit your changes, push the branch and open an **Pull Request** on the
   [main website repository](https://github.com/nf-neuro/website/pulls)
